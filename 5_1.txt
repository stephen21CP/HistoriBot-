Item 1: Beginning of the Precambrian
Date: 4.6 Billion Years Ago
Description: The Precambrian began with the earth's formation and lasted around 4 billion years. The geological processes of the Precambrian saw the creation of the earth’s crust and the oceans. Life began on Earth during this period, going from the earliest single-celled organisms to early bacteria andalgae(e.g., stromatolites) to the first multicellular organisms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 2: Earliest Known Life on Earth
Date: 3.48 Billion Years Ago
Description: While there is some evidence of life on Earth as early as 4.1 billion years ago, 3.48-billion-year-old stromatolite fossils in western Australia are the oldest undisputed direct evidence of life on Earth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 3: Beginning of the Formation of the Supercontinent Arctica
Date: 3.18 Billion Years Ago
Description: Arctica was one of the ancient continents that makes up much of what is now Canada, especially theCanadian Shieldarea inLabrador,Quebec,Ontario,Manitoba,Saskatchewan,Alberta,Northwest TerritoriesandNunavut. This land mass was formed between 2.5 and 1.9 billion years ago but originated from several older Archaean microcontinents that came together. Some of the rocks in these microcontinents are as old as 3.18 billion years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 4: Formation of the Supercontinent Nena
Date: 1.8 Billion Years Ago
Description: Around 1.8 billion years ago, several other microcontinents were welded to Arctica. This resulted in a new supercontinent known as Nena, which is an acronym for Northern Europe and North America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 5: Formation of the Supercontinent Rodinia
Date: 1.3 Billion Years Ago
Description: Rodinia, another ancient supercontinent, began forming around 1.3 billion years ago when the Grenville microcontinent connected with Nena. These land masses coming together resulted in the formation of the Grenville Mountains. Some remnants of the Grenville Mountains remain visible in North America, such as in the Appalachian and Adirondack mountains of eastern North America. As Rodinia was taking shape, massive mountains comparable to the Himalayas today were forming elsewhere around the world.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 6: Breakup of the Supercontinent Nena
Date: 1.1	Billion Years Ago
Description: Between 1.1 and 1.0 billion years ago, a mid-continental rift formed in the Nena land mass as the continent nearly split. This 2,000 km long, 20 km deep chasm is now filled with intrusive, volcanic and sedimentary rocks. In Canada, the remains of this rift are found nearLake Superior.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7: Breakup of the Supercontinent Rodinia
Date: 700 Million Years Ago
Description: Rodinia begins to break apart into smaller continents over millions of years. One of these continents that would later form Canada was Laurentia. Vast regions of Laurentia in what is now eastern Canada were covered by a shallow, warm ocean that was full of early marine life. This resulted in sedimentary deposits in the area, which are now known as the Paleozoic Cover Sequence or the Laurentian Platform. At this same time, over millions of years, the Grenville Mountains slowly eroded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 8: End of the Precambrian
Date: 541 Million Years Ago
Description: Ends of supereons, eons, eras and periods are often marked by major changes in geology, climate or organism diversity, sometimes culminating in extinction events. The Precambrian eons account for about 90 per cent of the history of the Earth to date. These eons saw increasing amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere as early cyanobacteria began photosynthesis and much tectonic activity. The Precambrian ended with the evolution of the firstanimals.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 9: Beginning of the Cambrian
Date: 541 Million Years Ago
Description: The beginning of the Cambrian Period is also the beginning of the Paleozoic Era. The Cambrian Period is characterized by the Cambrian explosion, in whichanimalsspread and diversified in the earth’s oceans and seas, especially along coastlines. Hard-shelled sea creatures became commonplace. Earlyarthropodsand chordates also evolved. During much of this time, extensive seas covered swaths of the Laurentian Platform, covering much of the east and west coasts of what would become Canada.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 10: End of the Cambrian – Cambrian Extinction
Date: 485 Million Years Ago
Description: A series of extinctions characterize the end of the Cambrian. These extinctions wiped out many marine organisms. Various factors may have led to these extinctions, such as volcanic activity, low oxygen levels in the oceans and changes in sea level. The boundaries between periods are often marked in rock strata at a place where the rock characterizes the differences between said periods, called the Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSP). The GSSP for the beginning of the Cambrian is in Fortune Head,Newfoundland.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 11: Beginning of the Ordovician
Date: 485 Million Years Ago
Description: The Ordovician Period saw the evolution and diversification of many important species ofinvertebrates, landplantsand armouredfish. During this period, much of what would become Canada was covered by ocean, save for areas of theCanadian ShieldandHudson BayLowlands, as well as what would become theMaritimes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 12: End of the Ordovician - Late Ordovician Mass Extinction Event (LOME)
Date: 443 Million Years Ago
Description: The end of the Ordovician Period is characterized by a mass extinction that killed up to 86 per cent of all species. This period of mass extinction took place over around 2 million years. Some theories about the cause of this mass extinction include a cooling climate, glaciations and changes in the ocean’s oxygen levels.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 13: Beginning of the Silurian
Date: 443 Million Years Ago
Description: During the Silurian Period, sea levels were high and continental land masses were low. As a result, there were many warm, shallow seas teeming with life, especially in what is now North America. Jawlessfish, like modernhagfishesandlampreys, were common. This period also saw extensive reef building and life spreading to freshwater ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems were also beginning to form, withlichens,arthropods(e.g.,millipedesandspiders) andmossesleading the way. During this time, the supercontinent of Gondwana covered much of the southern hemisphere.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 14: End of the Silurian
Date: 419 Million Years Ago
Description: The Silurian ended as terrestrial life, especiallyplantlife, rapidly diversified, leading directly into the Devonian Period. This period does not end with a major extinction event; instead, it is marked by a species of graptolite (a colonialinvertebrate) showing up in the fossil record. The presence of different species of graptolites in the fossil record are often used to mark the boundaries between time stages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 15: Beginning of the Devonian
Date: 419 Million Years Ago
Description: The Devonian Period saw an explosion of life on land, especially asplantsbegan to evolve rapidly. In the oceans,fishcontinued to diversify; the Devonian is often called the “Age of Fishes.” Though the landscape of what would become North America had large underwater portions, much of the east coast was terrestrial and part of the Laurasia supercontinent. Many terrestrial landscapes during this period saw great changes, including the first fish crawling onto land, such asTiktaalik, which was found inEllesmere Island,Nunavut. Other changes around the globe included the first forests of earlyconifer-liketrees. Trees profoundly impacted the entire planet, changing the earth’s climate, atmospheric oxygen levels and even oceanic nutrient cycling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 16: End of the Devonian – Late Devonian Extinction
Date: 358 Million Years Ago
Description: A series of extinction events resulted in the death of at least 70 per cent of the species on Earth, marking the end of the Devonian Period. This period is considered one of the big five mass extinction events. The widespread impacts of the evolution of land plants may have led to this mass extinction. Changes in marine nutrient cycling led toalgalblooms, rendering many ocean regions anoxic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 17: Beginning of the Carboniferous
Date: 358 Million Years Ago
Description: The Carboniferous Period was a golden age forplants. This lush period was filled with dense forests of earlyconifer-liketrees,mosses,fernsandhorsetails.Amphibiansandinsectswere widespread. Over time, the massive amount of swampforestsled to the formation of 90 per cent of the world'scoaldeposits, such as the deposits found today in the Appalachian regions of theMaritime provinces. In the oceans of the carboniferous,sharksdominated. Dryer regions allowed the evolution of the first amniotic egg and, consequently, the firstreptiles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 18: Formation of the Supercontinent Pangea
Date: 320 Million Years Ago
Description: The famous supercontinent of Pangea formed as the supercontinents Gondwanaland and Laurasia merged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 19: End of the Carboniferous - Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC)
Date: 298 Million Years Ago
Description: The end of the Carboniferous is characterized by an extinction event known as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC).  The later part of the Carboniferous experienced glaciation, changes in sea levels and climate change. As a result, many of the rich swampforestsdisappeared.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 20: Beginning of the Permian
Date: 298 Million Years Ago
Description: During the Permian,reptilesbegan to diversify, eventually giving rise todinosaursand mammals alike during the Triassic. During this period, the eastern half of present-day North America was part of the supercontinent Pangea, while shallow seas and islands covered the west coast.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 21: End of the Permian – Permian Triassic Extinction Event (PTEE)
Date: 252 Million Years Ago
Description: The Permian Period ended with a mass extinction known as the Permian Triassic Extinction Event (PTEE), in which over 90 per cent of all species disappeared. This mass extinction, the worst Earth has seen to date, is also known as the “great dying” and nearly ended all life on Earth. The exact cause of this mass extinction remains debated, though various natural catastrophes occurred around the same time, possibly explaining the massive loss of life. A runaway greenhouse effect began with a cataclysmic volcanic eruption that blasted CO2into the atmosphere. Methane, another greenhouse gas, was released by bacteria. Temperatures increased and the oceans acidified. Among the species lost were thetrilobites, who had first appeared in the Cambrian and survived prior mass extinctions. The end of the Permian Period also marked the end of the Paleozoic Era.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 22: Beginning of the Triassic
Date: 252 Million Years Ago
Description: It took millions of years for life to recover from the Permian extinction. During the Triassic, life began to diversify once more. This period saw the firstdinosaurs,mammalsand flyingreptiles. The beginning of the Triassic Period was also the beginning of the Mesozoic Era.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 23: End of the Triassic
Date: 201 Million Years Ago
Description: A mass extinction marked the end of the Triassic. During this mass extinction, 80 per cent of species were lost. The exact cause of this mass extinction remains unknown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 24: Beginning of the Jurassic
Date: 201 Million Years Ago
Description: One of the most famous periods in Earth’s history, the Jurassic saw largedinosaursdominate the land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 25: Breakup of Pangea
Date: 200 Million Years Ago
Description: During the Jurassic, Pangea began to break up, splitting along what is now the Atlantic coast. As this rift formed, it was filled with water, creating theAtlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean pushed North America westward, where it collided with various microcontinents. This collision resulted in the Cordilleran Orogeny, from which a precursor to theRocky Mountainswas formed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 26: Formation of the Western Interior Seaway
Date: 150 Million Years Ago
Description: TheWestern Interior Seawaybegan to form near the end of the Jurassic and lasted tens of millions of years. This sizeable inland sea split the continent of North America into two separate landmasses (Appalachia and Laramidia), connecting theArctic Oceanto the Gulf of Mexico. At its maximal size, the Western Interior Seaway was 2,000 km wide, 600 m deep and over 5,000 km long.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 27: End of the Jurassic
Date: 145 Million Years Ago
Description: The end of the Jurassic is difficult to define, as it is not marked by a major extinction event.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 28: Beginning of the Cretaceous
Date: 145 Million Years Ago
Description: The Cretaceous saw the evolution of the first floweringplants.Dinosaurscontinued to evolve, with famous species such asTyrannosaurus rexroaming the Cretaceous. This period also saw the evolution of the first placentalmammals. During this period, tectonic activity in western North America, known as the Servier Orogeny, contributed to the formation of theRocky Mountains.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 29: End of the Cretaceous and K-Pg Boundary
Date: 66 Million Years Ago
Description: The Cretaceous ended in a mass extinction following an asteroid impact. This famous mass extinction wiped out 76 per cent of all species, including all non-aviandinosaursand pterosaurs. Volcanic activity and climate change may have already weakened many species prior to the asteroid impact. The end of the Cretaceous Period was also the end of the Mesozoic era.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 30: Beginning of the Paleogene
Date: 66 Million Years Ago
Description: The Paleogene saw the further evolution ofbirds. Though birds had evolved by the late Cretaceous, it was not until after the extinction of the non-aviandinosaursthat birds began to diversify extensively. At the same time,mammalsbegan to increase in size. Notably, the first primates evolved. This period also saw tectonic activity along western North America in the form of the Laramide Orogeny, which further contributed to the formation of theRocky Mountains. The beginning of the Paleogene Period also marked the beginning of the Cenozoic Era.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 31: Western Interior Seaway Disappears
Date: 56 Million Years Ago
Description: After tens of millions of years, theWestern Interior Seawaygradually disappeared following a regional uplift and the continued mountain-building on the western side of North America. The Cannonball Sea, a Cenozoic Era remnant of the Western Interior Seaway, represents the last marine incursion into the western interior of North America, likely sometime between 56 and 66 million years ago.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 32: End of the Paleogene
Date: 23 Million Years Ago
Description: The Paleogene ended with a period of significant global change and an extinction event. Oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns changed due to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, resulting in the extinction of certain species.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 33: Beginning of the Neogene
Date: 23 Million Years Ago
Description: The Neogene saw the evolution of many modernbirdsandmammals. This period also saw the first upright-walking ancestors of humans, living in Africa. In certain areas, grassy ecosystems became widespread (seePrairie).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 34: End of the Neogene
Date: 2 Million Years Ago
Description: As the end of the Neogene approached, Earth experienced a global climate cooling. This led into the ice ages of the Quaternary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 35: Beginning of the Quaternary
Date: 2 Million Years Ago
Description: Much of the Quaternary is characterized by a long Ice Age broken up by warmer phases. About 315,000 years ago, modern humans evolved in Africa and began to spread worldwide. This period also saw the extinction ofmammalandbirdmegafauna such asmammoths.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 36: Last Glacial Maximum in North America
Date: 19,000 Years Ago
Description: North America experienced its last glacial maximum between 23,000 and 19,000 years ago. During this time, most of what is now Canada was covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which was as much as 4 km thick in some areas. As it retreated,forestsand wildlife followed, resulting in a landscape similar to today's.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
